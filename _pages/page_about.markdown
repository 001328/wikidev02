Welcome to **my azure data platform**!

I am Hendrik and my goal with this blog is to provide some guidance on **how I am building a data solution in azure**.
If you follow this Blog you will be able to deploy an enterprise-ready data platform to any azure subscription you or your company may own.

You will not find Ads or anything not vanilla in this repository to ensure it **meets european compliance rules**!

The basic deployment also includes an example Database and shows you how you can get from a transactional database to a data warehouse.

**Please be aware:** This is my personal opinion and I always try to be as close to best practice as possible. Feedback is more than welcome!

Topics we cover:

- CI/CD Deployments via GitHub Actions
- Azure Synapse Analytics
- Data Warehouse design and comparison to transactional database
- Data streaming and ingestion with Azure Event Hub
- Azure Purview
- Setting up a Wiki with GitHub pages
- Key Vault
- Working with GitHub Secrets
- Connecting GitHub Deployments and Azure DevOps

As this Blog will grow I will add more topics to this list (or first I add the topics and then I will work on them - not sure yet)
