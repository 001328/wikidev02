In the last post we started to customized the folder structure of our new template.
Now we want to work a little on the content.

This post will cover these topics:
* add readme and license
* add a favicon
* change the Title & Description
* change the Footer

## Add readme and License

If you want to run this as an open source project, now is the time to add readme and a license (obviously not required for enterprisev usage)
> We didn't do this initially to ensure we have a completely empty repository that we can first populate with our new website

The easiest way to do this is to create a new file and save it as **README** with the markdown extension.
Once you push it to GitHub its content will be displayed below your files.
You can populate it just like any other post or page with markdown.

Then create another file and save it as **LICENSE** without any extension

Now push everything to GitHub and open it there to edit (the little pencil on the bottom right).

this give you the option to choose a standard license template:

I chose the MIT License and commit at the bottom, create a pull request and then delete the branch **add-license-1** and the file LICENSE.txt

Check if there is still the other LICENSE.txt file in the repository. 
If so you can delete it

# Great Job!

This is how it should look like now

## Add a favicon

adding a [favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon){:target="_blank"} is a fun thing to do

> a favicon is the "favorite icon" you can see on top of a website

One way to do a quick favicon is to use powerpoint and Quickly draw something.

Now you can put this image into the [favicon generator]( https://realfavicongenerator.net/){:target="_blank"}


after it is generated the favicon generator give you everything you need to put it in your head.html
just download the package and place it in a folder "favicon" under "assets"

Next go to the folder _includes and create a new file **custom-head.html**

here, paste the code from the favicon generator

```
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/assets/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/assets/favicons/favicon-32x32.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="/assets/favicons/favicon-16x16.png">
<link rel="manifest" href="/assets/favicons/site.webmanifest">
<link rel="mask-icon" href="/assets/favicons/safari-pinned-tab.svg" color="#5bbad5">
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/assets/favicons/favicon.ico">
<meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#ffc40d">
<meta name="msapplication-config" content="/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml">
<meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff">
```

After you saved it go to **_layouts/default.html** and add the following code

```%- include custom-head.html -%```

After you pushed it to github you can enter your domain into the [favicon checker](https://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon_checker?ignore_root_issues=true#.YuCIubbMJD8){:target="_blank"}

## Change the Title & Description

You can change the title and description of your website in the **_config** file.

and that's already it.


## Change the Footer

Now let's see if we can make the Footer how we want it.

In my opinion all that Design stuff should be done by designers, I just want to make fast and simple adjustments so I have something I am happy with. 

That means for me:
* remove my personal email
* remove twitter and add linkedin an rss

all you need to do is to go into the **_config** file and do these steps:
* remove the email
* remove twitter_username
* add linkedin_username: youruser
* add rss: subscribe

last step is to remove the texztx "subscribe via RSS" from the main page.
go to **home.html** and remove line 31
